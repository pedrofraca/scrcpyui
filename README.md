## Install
`brew tap pedrofraca/brew; brew install scrcpyui`

 adb has to be accesible in the path in order to install it:

 `brew install --cask android-platform-tools`

## Usage
Once installed you just need to open it from Applications folder (you have to accept it from the security options).
And you'll get a status bar icon where you can see your devices connected, clicking on them will launch scrcpy
